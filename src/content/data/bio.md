## Welcome!
Hey! This is a website template that you can use to develop your **OWN PORTFOLIO WEBSITE!** Isn't that neat? 

### How to get started
You can begin by editing these markdown files to insert your own content. The [bio](/bio) file can be your starting place to tell the world a bit about yourself, while each card on the project page will give you a spot to highlight your achievements!

#### Smaller Title
You'll be able to add [links](https://example.com) and pictures!

##### An even smaller title!

*Plus, with simple knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript, you can make all sorts of wonderful modifications. Nothing is off limits if your mind can dream it and your fingers can get the code on the page!*
